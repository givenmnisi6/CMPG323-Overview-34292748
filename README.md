## Branching Strategy

In all of my projects, Branching strategies will be used since I want to avoid conflicts when I am merging them and also allow a much easier integration of changes made into the main trunk. Moreover, to help organize a series of planned, structured releases. A branching strategy that I will be using in all of my projects is GitHub-Flow. Since all of the projects are individually and we have a single release version for each of our projects for each repository, GitHub-Flow is the winner for me. GitHub Flow is a simple and effective way to support continuous deployment and release. It gives me a delivery-focused project as possible.
#### Implementation
<ul>
<li>The main is being branched to the feature branch, then code is added to the feature branch.</li>
<li>A pull request is created and pushed to pre-production while adding things and fixing bugs, when I'm content with the release I merge back to main.</li>
</ul>
This strategy eliminates a lot of room for error, if something goes wrong, I can simply roll back to the previous version.
<ul>
<li>The GitHub Flow branching strategy will consist of the following branches:  </li>
<li>Master (main) - for production purposes </li>
<li>Feature/task - for the development of new features </li>
<li>Hotfix - to assist when there's a bug that has been found and needs fixing in production. A hotfix originates from the master branch and merges back into the master and develops. </li>
</ul>
